# Linesman
Linesman is a middleware service level which acts as a go-between for Referee and The Pitch. It is a Tornado Web Application and handles requests asynchronously but also to respond to events raised from Referee and forward them onto the correct users according to the preferences recieved from Playbook

To set up, install Python3.5 and set up a virtualenv with that version.
